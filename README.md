A text based adventure i made for prog 1 project, its really cool but bad.

A project i made for progamming 1 and is an interactive text based game with an UI.

Run the main py file and put the command line window into full screen.

Remove the input after each enter key press. There is a bug where keys are saved when playing minigame and will interfear in selection of story..
